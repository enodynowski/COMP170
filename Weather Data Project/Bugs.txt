So far these are the main issues that I have had to troubleshoot
    1) I have had some trouble initially parsing through the JSON data that was given from the API
        -SOLVED: I forgot to call the method from main haha. Also it took some time to get used to using the json.simple library
    
    2) I then had some trouble getting my program to print the correct values, and it was using the provided location key to search globally
       and was returning data for random places in Europe and SE Asia
        -SOLVED: I had to initially cast the data to a JSON Array and then navigate through the nested objects
    
    3) I had some issues where, in the process of trying to obfuscate my API key from the URL, it wouldn't be reinserted when trying to create the new 
       URL class. 
        -SEMI-SOLVED: I havent successfully obfuscated my API key yet, but i have been able to get the URLs to work again. Can only
        pass one variable in at a time for some reason. 
    
    4) While adding in functionality that takes user input for what zip code they would like weather data from, I kept receiving 401 errors
        -SOLVED: the URL was not being processed correctly, and for whatever reason the API key was not being passed into it
    
    5) Currently struggling to work through how to add in a caching mechanism. Have experimented briefly with in-memory caching, which proved to be
       pretty difficult. Also experimented briefly with some local file caching, and caching to an array and an arraylist.
        -SOLVED: I was able to implement local file caching functionality. It now reads data from a local file if the location has been queried in the
        past 24hr. Otherwise it calls to the API, gets the data, writes it to a file, then reads from the file.
    
    6) While implementing caching feature, I was receiving null pointer exceptions in a for loop in the readDataFromFile method
        -SOLVED: I accidentally put a space between Daily and Forecasts in line 70
    
    7) While determining the age of the file, I was receiving an issue where it was returning 0ms no matter what
        -SOLVED: I forgot to include a / after the word caching, so it was never actually finding the file in the first place.
    
    8) After implementing the caching functionality, my curly brackets in mainLogic() were messed up, and it would never reach the 
       else statement that calls getLocationCode().
        -SOLVED: Changed up the way that my brackets are set up in the if/else statements
    
    9) The way that JSONparser works, is that the json data must not contain any newlines or spaces. This means that when printing the output in 
       output formatting, there are no spaces between things like "intermittent" and "clouds" or "mostly" and "sunny"
        -UNSOLVED:
